# mpms-project
Custom management and self-check-in software I wrote for use at my own table tennis club.

This is a complete Java project which can be loaded into the latest NetBeans IDE. The program can also be run with sample data by executing the MatchPointMS.jar file located in the 'distribution' directory.

The program contains an embedded Derby database very similar to the one I created for use in an application I created for my previous employer.

The first tab in the application functions as a self-check-in kiosk for players to register in the system and check in to play for the day. Admin features can be accessed using the password 'admin'. (Exiting the application is considered an admin feature.)
